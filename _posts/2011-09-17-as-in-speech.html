<i>"Not only was I sharing my work so that others could find it useful, I also wanted feedback (okay, and praise).
It didn't make sense to charge people who could potentially help me improve my work. â€¦

you must make them available to everybody in source code (as opposed to binaries, which are inaccessible)."</i>
