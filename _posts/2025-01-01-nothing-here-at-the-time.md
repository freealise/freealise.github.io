Free verse is an open form of poetry which does not use a prescribed or regular meter 
or rhyme and tends to follow the rhythm of natural or irregular speech. 
Free verse encompasses a large range of poetic form...

(is not really free, only very complex,  
is different from prose by a _lack of predetermined idea_  
and following the sound instead of image or along with it, like any verse)
