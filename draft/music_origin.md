Free verse is an open form of poetry which does not use a prescribed or regular meter 
or rhyme and tends to follow the rhythm of natural or irregular speech. 
Free verse encompasses a large range of poetic form...

(is not really free, only very complex,  
is different from prose by a _lack of predetermined idea_  
and following the sound instead of image or along with it, like any verse)  

Music is not luxury or background only for elevated emotional state
but an assistance for thinking nonverbally and in verse.  
The tune is the value shift(s) of a story by derivative of pitch   
or the stress and formant pattern of speech harmonised and exaggerated for clarity.  

An instrument is required so that another person can do the same  
even with no sense of pitch or voice,  
also as meditative and mnemonic device for the working class 
like for modern people the computer.  
  
Tune, rhythm and phoneme formants with harmonized pitch variation  
and slant rhyme in any place of line are contained in speech -  
which is like a story on every level (verse / line / bar / beat / note)  

Brainwaves directly synchronize with music (binaural beats are optional).
