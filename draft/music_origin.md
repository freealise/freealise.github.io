#### 'I blog in lyrics' <- 'small images'

Free verse is an open form of poetry which does not use a prescribed or regular meter 
or rhyme and tends to follow the rhythm of natural or irregular speech. 
Free verse encompasses a large range of poetic form...

(is not really free, only very complex,  
is different from prose by a _lack of predetermined idea_  
and following the sound instead of image or along with it, like any verse)  

Music is not luxury or background only for elevated emotional state
but an assistance for thinking nonverbally and in verse.  
The tune is the value(s) shift of a story by derivative of (?) pitch,  
also the semantic stress (by speed, volume and pitch variation) and formant pattern of speech   
with words in subtext, harmonised and exaggerated for clarity.  

An instrument is required so that another person can do the same  
even with no sense of pitch or voice,  
also as meditative and mnemonic device for the working class 
like for modern people the computer.  
  
Tune, rhythm and phoneme formants with harmonized pitch variation  
and slant rhyme in any place of line are contained in speech -  
which is like a story on every level (verse / line / bar / beat / note)  

! Brainwaves directly synchronize with music (binaural beats are optional).

  A tune is a a stress (volume + pitch + length) and value shift hierarchy (fractalising)  
  Cantillation = five points connected by four segments, octave range  
  
"small images" = protective patterns; long landscapes; any vector picture viewed nonlinearly for sound patterns  
  
  "I've found a page among my papers," said Goethe, "where I describe architecture as frozen music. And there’s something in that, you know; the state of mind produced by architecture is similar to the effect of music."  
  
! How to attain the love and remove the fear:  
  The power of evil can not be used directly, it has to be confused. To confuse it, patterns are made, which are neither traditional (idolatry) nor anyone's personal expression (human worship) nor random (atheism). They are instead found in the environment.  
  
is (along with other show business) a beneficial psychedelic drug, while not a medicine (like herbs that the same practitioners also use) as it has to be personally relevant to be efficient like psychotherapy ("white magic")  
guitar is held against 2nd chkr (belly button) - cure IBS ?  
  
Semantically, music is used to promote a cause as well as general charity (strength) or education (+develops the spirit of sacrifice in the Temple) = non-commercial context-sensitive advertising of a yet nonexistent idea  
  
"Your Lord knows best all those in the heavens and the earth. And We have surely favoured some prophets above others, and to David We gave the Psalms." (Quran 17:55)  
 The reason David is singled out here is because some Jewish authorities at the time of the Prophet (ﷺ) claimed that no scripture had been revealed after Moses. So this verse refutes this claim by referring to the Psalms of David.
