Any text has <b>form</b>, either sentences are arranged in order of importance or a story is told chronologically.
Unlike prose, lyrics have <b>rhythm</b> and <b>melody</b>, which are closer to natural speech than the strict <b>meter</b> of poetry.
Both can have <b>rhymes</b> and <b>alliterations</b>, which might include only the vowel or consonant of a syllable.
It is more important that the word containing them is a <b>keyword</b>, than the rhyme's position within a line.

<!-- storyboard of video is presented as a comic with transcript in alt; audio track for music with subtitles -->


  <!--music and lyrics - graphic novels have no speech, are badly searchable and copyrighted, movies have speech and are searchable but copyrighted, both have meaningful images which are also a mnemonic device most music videos don't have: break own music videos into frames with speech bubbles and lyric lines for interactive subtitles-->
  <!--albums include all common words and grammar constructions in books and magazines (controlled vocabulary and standard levels ?)-->
  <!--learn second language this way for credibility-->

I'm actually a programmer. But I didn't manage to release or sell any apps for many years, as I've been trying to do it for someone foreign while never specific about 
who that is. It was not anyone's necessity, only a job - I've just been convinced I am to be their supply chain due to nationality and not being used to capitalism.
