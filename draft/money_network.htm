<h3><i class="material-icons">card_membership</i> <i>Place the crowdfunding widget on your site</i></h3>
You are an entrepreneur who has a website or blog that can attract enough audience to be a sustainable business. Doing your best to promote and monetize it, you might think about displaying ads or sponsored content on your own pages. But your customers are going to despise it or use an adblocker, and will more likely go away when you tell them to switch it off. Instead of discounting your items or hiding content behind a paywall, copy and paste the widget code to show it on every page of your site. / (add link to freealise / keyword / hashtag)
</div>

<div class="p">
<h3><i class="material-icons">local_atm</i> <i>Accept sponsorship from your audience</i></h3>
You need to have a <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a> payment provider account and live in a <a href="https://stripe.com/global" target="_blank">supported country</a> or register a business there, which is easy to do with <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas" target="_blank">Stripe Atlas</a>.
In your account, <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/products/create" target="_blank">add a one-time and a recurring product</a>, each of them worth $1, and call them "one-time support" and "sponsorship" or anything like that.
Into the form that generates the widget code you have to copy their unique IDs that begin with "sku_" and "plan_", as well as page addresses on your site for successful and cancelled payment, also fill in the necessary amount, suggested contribution, starting point which is the funds you already have (as you don't want to start at zero), and purpose of the payments. 
Make a new <a href="https://script.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Apps Script</a> project and copy this code into it, then click Publish and Deploy as web app with "Execute the app as" set to "Me" and access to "Anyone, even anonymous", copy the current web app URL and paste it into the form.

<h3><i class="material-icons">local_mall</i> <i>Give away free products or services</i></h3>
To give people a reason to support you, you have to not only give promises but provide value at no cost. 
Great if you are already doing it on your blog or release free software or other work available for download. 
But if you sell physical goods or services that require human participation, the widget lets you start a giveaway. 
Deliver your product or service to everyone who confirmed they wish to receive it and have a coherent and relevant website. / (add giveaway)
