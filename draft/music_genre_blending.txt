phonetic writing and story (folk) / layered composition (classics) / unconventional rhythm as meter (jazz) / slant rhyme (rap) / spectral synthesis (electronic)
meditation (kabbala) / accessible folk song with elevated subject (nigunim) / synthesizer instead of piano / rhythm and fiddle (progressive electric klezmer) / overdub layers (classics)

electric folk fusion = 'tea with herbs'
shamanism as international proto-religion (!= theology or tribe leadership)

jewish (in broader sense) folk tale and music - Wilburys as a tribe
anarchist micronation site (~IF interface) - interactive Antarctic story about the future
modern shaman

what is prayer for - elevated rap ?
not to affect probability of events directly but the state of mind by self-hypnosis (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hypnosis#Definition)
music = legal drugs or meditation, not only a means to state a point (as is never the best way for it)
(https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Meditation)

if politics is altogether rejected by people for psychological reasons, promote religion 
or tell stories related to the subject but not directly about it (genre != Society)
  
modern people (thanks to education) worship not art but the artist, therefore the genre furthest from idolatry would be (ironically) folk - the one with the least personality
'I hate art' = 'I hate worship of talent and creativity as a quality'
