    Prayer is a spiritual political program where you are not the candidate but on the team of the Lord, King of the universe. It is not an ask but an offer that you don't personally have the means to fulfill. Storygrid internal genre (roughly aligns to three major faiths). (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religious_Jewish_music) Its form is a marginal case of music due to cantillation melody and possible swaying (like rap due to rhythm and slant rhyme).</div><div><span><span style="color: #1d2a57; font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="color: #1d2a57; font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5783136/jewish/Love-Ahavah.htm">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5783136/jewish/Love-Ahavah.htm</a></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
    Prayer is meditation on the ideas in the siddur (or your own on same subject) cumulatively, not pronouncing them out in words (like affirmation).
    Prayer is confession (https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.14.3?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en)
    (edit the siddur - https://asknoah.org/asknoah_resource/prayers-blessings-principles-of-faith-and-divine-service-for-noahides)
    The point of prayer is not to remind G‑d of what we need from Him; rather, it is to remind ourselves of what He “needs” from us.
    Prayer is only answered if sincere = for what is required for meaningful life to continue (is 'primal'), not any 'want' or desire.
    Is for negative / obsessive / pointless thought termination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9#Religion)

    Nazirite = teacher, separated person engaged in the Torah
    shamanic song, not recital
    
    Practical (manipulative and forbidden) and meditative Kabbalah differ by intention / motivation (kavanah) and not by specific practice, assuming that it works at all (what doesn't is forbidden to keep young people from disappointment which may lead to loss of faith).  
    Another distinction is the completeness of information available and the amount of mystery involved, as mystery is not reliable to act upon.

मर्त्यस्तयानुसवमेधितया मुकुन्द-

By listening to, chanting and contemplating on the charming stories 
of Bhagavān Sri Krsna every moment, man develops the devotion 
which leads him to the (supreme) sphere of the Lord. 
(True,) it is (most) difficult to reach beyond the jurisdiction of Time; 
but in the Lord's realm Time has no sway. 
Even rulers of the earth have left their kingdom and retired to the forest 
for (the performance of austerities with the object of) gaining that eternal realm. 
(Therefore, one should constantly engage oneself in hearing the stories of the Lord.)
