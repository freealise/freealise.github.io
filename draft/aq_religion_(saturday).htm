<p>There are essentially two commandments that are never violated out of necessity - the L-rd is one, do not worship idols</p>

<p>The purpose of evil, which is subordinate, is motivation for improvement</p>

<p>Corruption of the Jews came from their actions and corruption of the Christians came from their knowledge. The Jews had knowledge yet did not act upon it, and the Christians acted without knowledge.

<p>Zoroastrian deity was anthropomorphic and therefore dualistic, the Shia (and the Christians except those Protestants who don't deify Jesus) worship literal human beings in a hierarchy.</p>

  "Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth for a reason?"
  
  "Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺."  
  
  "So compete with one another in doing good." (Quran 2:148)
  
  "Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹
  The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. 
  Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”

  "Do not falter in pursuit of the enemy—if you are suffering, they too are suffering. But you can hope to receive from Allah what they can never hope for. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise." (4:104)

  This ˹sending of the messengers˺ is because your Lord would never destroy a society for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware ˹of the truth˺. (6:131)

    Prayer is a spiritual political program where you are not the candidate but on the team of the Lord, King of the universe. It is not an ask but an offer that you don't personally have the means to fulfill. Storygrid internal genre (roughly aligns to three major faiths). (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religious_Jewish_music) Its form is a marginal case of music due to cantillation melody and possible swaying (like rap due to rhythm and slant rhyme).</div><div><span><span style="color: #1d2a57; font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="color: #1d2a57; font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5783136/jewish/Love-Ahavah.htm">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5783136/jewish/Love-Ahavah.htm</a></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
    Prayer is meditation on the ideas in the siddur (or your own on same subject) cumulatively, not pronouncing them out in words (like affirmation).
    Prayer is confession (https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.14.3?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en)
    Prayer is the only form of speech when a person is completely frank and not speaking with self-interest or diplomatic correctness  
    (edit the siddur - https://asknoah.org/asknoah_resource/prayers-blessings-principles-of-faith-and-divine-service-for-noahides)
    The point of prayer is not to remind G‑d of what we need from Him; rather, it is to remind ourselves of what He “needs” from us.
    Prayer is only answered if sincere = for what is required for meaningful life to continue (is 'primal'), not any 'want' or desire.
    Is for negative / obsessive / pointless thought termination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9#Religion)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placing_notes_in_the_Western_Wall  
    ...women are only required to pray once a day, in any form they choose, so long as the prayer contains praise of (brakhot), requests to (bakashot), and thanks of (hodot) G-d.  
    
    Prayer is an elevated curse / false witness / disrespect (for those inclined to either)  
      which can also become a story (long elaborate curses naturally end in a joke)  
      or kernel of a story as subject  
        tell about the Moshiach in second person ?  
        sermons in rhyme ?  
    
    Prayer is usually for the unconscious, not the conscious (to replace the static of the mind like earworms or obsessions)  
    shamanic song or chant, not recital (has to be catchy), in second person  
    (while also being nonsense) "Earworm songs usually have a fast-paced tempo and an easy-to-remember melody.  
    However, earworms also tend to have unusual intervals or repetitions that make them stand out from other songs.  
    Earworms also tend to be played on the radio more than other songs and are usually featured at the top of the charts."  
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm)  
      
    ! the Amidah goes along the respective qualities of the sefirot from the top  
    the point of standard prayer is togetherness not repetition (the technical possibility to keep one without the other is / was limited)  
    https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/110505/print/true/jewish/Torah-Studies-Terumah.htm  

    do not beg your G-d for ideas by vain speech but be quiet and meditate  
    “because I was a boor and as an animal, I was always with You” (Likkutei Amarim 18:11)  
    requests on behalf of community or for (nonverbal or verbal) personal guidance (ironically)  
    
    ! Think of the content of prayer while saying words in any language to avoid hypocrisy (pronounce syllables, phonemes or nothing as meditation)  
    ! Daydreaming is not deliberately imagining but dreamlike conscience in waking life (the opposite of lucid dream) which is the beginning of meditation  
    
    "For through breaking one’s heart the spirit of uncleanliness of the sitra achara is broken" (Likkutei Amarim 17:6)  
      
    Kabbalah ascribes a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer,  
    which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself,  
    restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. (the Zohar)  
    
    Practical (magical) and meditative Kabbalah both require appropriate motivation (kavanah) and what is forbidden is not specific practice but manipulative intentions,  
      assuming that they work at all (what doesn't or what you're not capable of is forbidden to keep people from disappointment which may lead to loss of faith).  
    "Idolatry always has ulterior motives." (Source: Likkutei Sichot, Vol. I pp. 183-187)
    Another distinction is the completeness of information available and the amount of mystery and entropy involved, as it isn't reliable and predictable to depend upon.  
    (https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380714/jewish/Contemplative-vs-Practical-Kabbalah.htm)  
    Magic is disappointing as it only works for certain people in specific circumstances, and is an inherited ability not everyone can learn  
    theurgy: the operation or effect of a supernatural or divine agency in human affairs. (Oxford Dictionary)  
    
    "All ridicule is forbidden except for ridiculing idol worship" (Kitzur Shulchan Arukh)  
    "It is considered a great mitzvah to ridicule idol worship and deride an evil and immoral way of life" (Siddur Arizal)  
      ! a gentile would be allowed to comment on the Torah like a Christian as a nonsense joke  
      nationality is a popular modern idol that is mocked with exagerrated stereotypes  
    
    Nazirite = teacher, separated person engaged in the Torah ?  
    Meditation, contemplation, mindfulness, reflection and prayer  
    
    ! Prayer is to elevate the imperfect animal soul, so has to be a physical practice

10 sefirot but 7 chakras (except Tiferet, Yesod and Malkhut, as they're ideals between the pairs of opposites and not related to the body)
pair of opposites for malkhut are on the lower level of comprehension and are the chochma and binah - political freedom (explorative) & regulation (intuitive) - as right and left are gevurah and chesed  
"...two perceiving or non-rational functions (Sensation ('animal soul' = interface between body and soul) and Intuition), and two judging or rational functions (Thinking and Feeling).  
These functions are modified by two main attitude types: extraversion and introversion."  
the sefirot align to personal traits not as binary opposites but as a continuum of prevalence with most people near the middle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics)  
  pairs of sefirot can be sorted by subjective importance to the person (with the neglected being less balanced and more subject to moral flaw), providing more types (<-'psychosophy'), temperaments: extravert|introvert, rational|irrational  
  types of relation: ahavah, philia, eros and storge  
  
  "For just as in the case of a material candle, the light shines by virtue of the annihilation and burning of the wick turning to fire,  
  so does the light of the Shechinah rest on the divine soul as a result of the annihilation of the animal soul and its transformation  
  from darkness to light and from bitterness to sweetness in the case of the righteous,  
  or at least through the destruction of its garments, which are thought, speech, and action,  
  and their transformation from the darkness of the kelipot to the Divine light of the En Sof, blessed is He,  
  which is clothed and united in the thought, speech, and action of the 613 commandments of the Torah, in the case of benonim." (Likkutei Amarim, 53:6)
  
  Ein Sof - source, Atzilut - idea, Beriyah - thought, Yetzirah - speech, Asiyah - action  
  both Divine and natural soul have levels of consciousness; the natural is expanded by various means, the Divine only by meditation  
  filters of light not only limit its intensity, but are _colored_ and represent the brainwave frequencies (with which the base frequency of the chant is synchronized)  
  
  Partzufim are characters representing qualities in storytelling, any combinations are possible  
  only as _example_: Zeir anpin = protagonist; Abba, Ima, Nukva = secondary (https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380804/jewish/Unit-of-Creation.htm)  
  
the ten commandments are a Maslow pyramid  

the difference between Torah and the commandments is this:  
through a Mitzvah one becomes nullified in the face of G-d’s will, as a “chariot to its rider.”  
But through Torah we become one with G-d.

...according to one rabbinic opinion, mostly-righteous individuals are punished in this world for the sins they have committed, in order that they may be purely rewarded in the World to Come (Leviticus Rabbah 27:1)

The difference between human and AI is that a human can make sense out of nonsense. The difference between G-d and human is that G-d can make sense out of nothing.

By listening to, chanting and contemplating on the charming stories 
of Bhagavān Sri Krsna every moment, man develops the devotion 
which leads him to the (supreme) sphere of the Lord. 
(True,) it is (most) difficult to reach beyond the jurisdiction of Time; 
but in the Lord's realm Time has no sway. 
Even rulers of the earth have left their kingdom and retired to the forest 
for (the performance of austerities with the object of) gaining that eternal realm. 
(Therefore, one should constantly engage oneself in hearing the stories of the Lord.)
