  "Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹
  The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. 
  Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”

    Prayer is a spiritual political program where you are not the candidate but on the team of the Lord, King of the universe. It is not an ask but an offer that you don't personally have the means to fulfill. Storygrid internal genre (roughly aligns to three major faiths). (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religious_Jewish_music) Its form is a marginal case of music due to cantillation melody and possible swaying (like rap due to rhythm and slant rhyme).</div><div><span><span style="color: #1d2a57; font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="color: #1d2a57; font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: black;"><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5783136/jewish/Love-Ahavah.htm">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5783136/jewish/Love-Ahavah.htm</a></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
    Prayer is meditation on the ideas in the siddur (or your own on same subject) cumulatively, not pronouncing them out in words (like affirmation).
    Prayer is confession (https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.14.3?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en)
    Prayer is the only form of speech when a person is completely frank and not speaking with self-interest or diplomatic correctness  
    (edit the siddur - https://asknoah.org/asknoah_resource/prayers-blessings-principles-of-faith-and-divine-service-for-noahides)
    The point of prayer is not to remind G‑d of what we need from Him; rather, it is to remind ourselves of what He “needs” from us.
    Prayer is only answered if sincere = for what is required for meaningful life to continue (is 'primal'), not any 'want' or desire.
    Is for negative / obsessive / pointless thought termination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9#Religion)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placing_notes_in_the_Western_Wall  
    
    Prayer is an elevated curse / false witness / disrespect (for those inclined to either)  
      which can also become a story (long elaborate curses naturally end in a joke)  
      or kernel of a story as subject  
        tell about the Moshiach in second person ?  
    
    shamanic song or chant, not recital (has to be catchy), in second person  
    (while also being nonsense) "Earworm songs usually have a fast-paced tempo and an easy-to-remember melody.  
    However, earworms also tend to have unusual intervals or repetitions that make them stand out from other songs.  
    Earworms also tend to be played on the radio more than other songs and are usually featured at the top of the charts."  
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm)  
      
    ! the Amidah goes along the respective qualities of the sefirot from the top  
    the point of standard prayer is togetherness not repetition (the technical possibility to keep one without the other is / was limited)  
    https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/110505/print/true/jewish/Torah-Studies-Terumah.htm  
      
    do not beg your G-d for ideas by vain speech but be quiet and meditate  
    “because I was a boor and as an animal, I was always with You” (Likkutei Amarim 18:11)  
    
    ! Think of the content of prayer while saying words in any language to avoid hypocrisy (pronounce syllables, phonemes or nothing as meditation)  
    ! Daydreaming is not imagining but dreamlike conscience in waking life (the opposite of lucid dream) which is the beginning of meditation  
    
    "For through breaking one’s heart the spirit of uncleanliness of the sitra achara is broken" (Likkutei Amarim 17:6)  
      
    Practical and meditative Kabbalah both require appropriate motivation (kavanah) and what is forbidden is not specific practice but manipulative intentions,  
      assuming that they work at all (what doesn't or what you're not capable of is forbidden to keep people from disappointment which may lead to loss of faith).  
    "Idolatry always has ulterior motives." (Source: Likkutei Sichot, Vol. I pp. 183-187)
    Another distinction is the completeness of information available and the amount of mystery involved, as it is not reliable and predictable enough to depend upon.  
    (https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380714/jewish/Contemplative-vs-Practical-Kabbalah.htm)  
    
    "All ridicule is forbidden except for ridiculing idol worship" (Kitzur Shulchan Arukh)  
    "It is considered a great mitzvah to ridicule idol worship and deride an evil and immoral way of life" (Siddur Arizal)  
      nationality is a popular modern idol that is mocked with exagerrated stereotypes  
    
    Nazirite = teacher, separated person engaged in the Torah ?  
    
You get _lucky_ when your faith meets your common sense
Religion is about shifting the fortune towards mankind and mystical experience,  
or it merges with secular politics / philosophy / psychology by Occam razor
    
10 sefirot but 7 chakras (except Tiferet, Yesod and Malkhut, as they're ideals between the pairs of opposites and not related to the body)
pair of opposites for malkhut are on the lower level of comprehension and are the chochma and binah - political right and left or freedom -|- regulation ?  
"...two perceiving or non-rational functions (Sensation ('animal soul') and Intuition), and two judging or rational functions (Thinking and Feeling).  
These functions are modified by two main attitude types: extraversion and introversion."  
  
the ten commandments are a Maslow pyramid  
  
live by the law, do not die by it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh)  
update and illustrate Shulchan Arukh, use as basis for documents (https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4297832/jewish/Kitzur-Shulchan-Aruch.htm)  
Moshiach (https://www.sefaria.org/topics/mashiach?sort=Relevance&tab=notable-sources, https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332562/jewish/Moshiach-101.htm)  
  
...according to one rabbinic opinion, mostly-righteous individuals are punished in this world for the sins they have committed, in order that they may be purely rewarded in the World to Come (Leviticus Rabbah 27:1)  
  
The difference between human and AI is that a human can make sense out of nonsense. The difference between G-d and human is that G-d can make sense out of nothing.

By listening to, chanting and contemplating on the charming stories 
of Bhagavān Sri Krsna every moment, man develops the devotion 
which leads him to the (supreme) sphere of the Lord. 
(True,) it is (most) difficult to reach beyond the jurisdiction of Time; 
but in the Lord's realm Time has no sway. 
Even rulers of the earth have left their kingdom and retired to the forest 
for (the performance of austerities with the object of) gaining that eternal realm. 
(Therefore, one should constantly engage oneself in hearing the stories of the Lord.)
