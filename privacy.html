<h3>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p>We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email, name and address, which you submit to us through the subscription, payment and contact form at the Site.</p>

<h4>1. Information collected via Technology</h4>

<p>To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you may need to submit further Personal Information, which may include your name and address. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Brand may use cookies to collect the following information: the referring URL, time and date of access, location of access.<br>
The Brand may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. We generally use persistent cookies.</p>

<h4>Non-Personal Information:</h4>

<p>In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience.
