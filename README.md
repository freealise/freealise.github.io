train AI on Sefaria -> blog [sefaria, opensiddur]<br/>
can be secular and assist a writer (storygrid), legislation based on precedent (or be a consultant), detect propaganda or corruption (if has enough data https://smlouvy.gov.cz/), trade stocks.<br/>
can find data on its own by googling and spidering ?<br/>
train multiple times on same data and use average to reduce stochasticity (also moving average ?)
