[II: went to music school and it sucked]<br />
[problem: learning to play like everyone]<br />
[solution: modifications]<br />
[outcome: songwriting]<br />
<br />
I have an electric violin,<br />
an all thirds (EG#CEG#C) electroacoustic guitar,<br />
a 12-string microtonal guitar tuned like a piano,<br />
and a tablet device and spectral synthesizer as a keyboard.<br />
<br />

-[notation] I used to listen to rock with classical influences and this got me interested in music theory.<br />
-[piano keys and chords] I could not understand why the piano keys are not flat and not on the same level which makes it only harder to play, as the chords of the same kind look and feel different.<br/>
-[piano and equal temperation] And why all the instruments are tuned this way and not any other, while the intervals between the notes are not exactly harmonic.<br/>
-[piano and harmonic intervals] I wanted to go beyond the equal temperament, which is possible with a violin or cello.<br/><br/>

-[cello and tempered / harmonic scale] (B Story - Fourier) Sound is a combination of natural harmonics, and in equal temperament the differences between the note frequencies are an approximation of harmonic intervals.<br />
-[violin fretboard problem] A violin's fingerboard looks linear from the violinist's point of view and the distance between the notes is visually the same anywhere on it, but it does not have frets and those intervals are narrow, so it isn't easy to be played in tune.<br />
-[violin solution] The notes on my violin are marked with stickers which look like frets and the ones for sharps or flats are also there, they don't have an obvious pattern.<br />
-[violin bow] I could not handle the bow right but have figured out that you're not supposed to press on it to make a sound, it does it all by itself, pulled down by gravity - even on the contrary, you have to lift it up a bit.<br />
<br />

-[guitar and standard tuning] (the antagonist's object of desire is technical achievement) I wanted polyphony and started learning the guitar, but could not remember the chords - because again the similar ones did not look the same, as the standard guitar tuning (EADGBE) has a different pitch interval between the second and third open strings.<br />
-[guitar and custom tuning] Now my guitar has a custom tuning, and it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_thirds_tuning" target="_blank">all major thirds</a> (EG#CEG#C) - though you often have to do barres or place a finger across two strings, I like it better as the chords look simple and beautiful and their progressions are obvious.<br/>
-[guitar and frets] But unfortunately, a regular guitar can not be played outside equal temperament.<br />
-[fretless guitar] Even on a fretless guitar the exact harmonic intervals are impossible to find because of the varying distance between the notes along the fretboard.<br/><br/>

(do not describe interface and features, show the principle and benefits)
-[microtonal guitar] The kind of guitar that can be played this way is tuned like a piano and played by pressing the strings upon the frets, have 12 or 24 metal strings and 12x more frets to make the scale stepless and continuous - still it is easy to master as the pitch intervals are shown on the surface.<br />
-[synth touchscreen] There is a way to emulate this is with a software synth and a touchscreen.<br />
-[synth sound control] The visual spectral way of synthesis is the most intuitive, so the sine waves and noise are overdubbed in the editor to form a kind of a spectral brush, and the natural voice of instruments can also be transformed this way.

The app is a visual additive and spectral synth and subtractive filter. It has an editor for recorded audio and works as a standalone multitrack recorder and sequencer.<br />
<div>
The instrument is a flatboard with strings that you play by tapping on.&nbsp;Its strings are tuned the same as any keyboard and intervals are shown on the surface. It has many frets, 12 times as many as a guitar, so you are not limited to the equal temperation that almost every other instrument imposes on you.</div>

The history of this project goes back to 2001, when I was 14 or 15.<br />
I wanted to understand why the guitar and keyboard are tuned this way and not any other. I found out what the <u>tempered scale</u> was. This was a convention I wanted to break out of.<br />
I invented an instrument that consisted of several <u>ribbon controllers</u>&nbsp;(the multitouch screens were not yet popular). I didn't get round to making it then.<br />
&lt;pic&gt;<br />
I began studying synthesizer programming and discovered that audio can be:<br />
<ul>
<li>recorded</li>
<li>programmed as code or in a modular way</li>
<li>visualized <u>spectrally</u> as a combination of harmonics and noise</li>
<li>presented as a table of numbers</li>
<li>sampled and described with keywords to be searchable</li>
</ul>
There are other means of synthesis like <u>wavelets</u> or <u>FM</u>, but only the intuitive ones interested me.<br />
<br />
Ages after <u>quadrophony</u> went out of fashion and was replaced by Surround, I invented this as well.<br />
&lt;pic&gt;<br />
<br />
Then the touchscreens went on sale, but I wanted to simplify things. Audio doesn't have to be synthesized. Why not strings instead of a keyboard?<br />
&lt;pic&gt;<br />
<br />
As well, I don't like paying for software. I like free software and suppose everyone else does.<br />
You have to pay for the hardware, but I don't want even that. So <i>multichord</i> is a non-profit.<br />
<br />
I don't want the customer to grab their purchase and run away. I want them to stay with the community and be part of it, being promoted and spreading the word, me and them being mutual fans and friends.<br />
